# randomQuoteGenerator_projectFive_openClassrooms
Project five random quote generator presented to openClassrooms International

Step 1: Random quotes
A random quotation or text generator is a tool that creates random fake quotes by assembling sentence fragments. 

One example is RandomTextGenerator. It's your turn to create one! You must respect the following criteria:

The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call

Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)

The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)

The program can simply display each result in the JavaScript console.

Step 2: More customized quotes
You now want to go further and offer the following options:

Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)

Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)

Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program

Adapt the program so that it has these features!

Deliverables
Files to provide:

A JavaScript file of your code for step 1 ;

A JavaScript file of your code for step 2.
For your deliverables to be processed by the jury, upload all project deliverables onto the platform in a folder named "P5_first_name". Each deliverable must be named with the project number and in the order in which it appears, e.g. "P5_01_javascriptfile". 

Presentation
You'll do an oral presentation of your project with an assessor in order to simulate real-life conditions. 

The presentation will be structured as follows:  

Presentation of your code and your quotation generator: 15-20 minutes
Q&A: 10 minutes
Towards the end of the presentation, the assessor will debrief you for approximately 5 minutes.
